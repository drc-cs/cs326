# Introduction to Data Science Pipelines 

[[Github Repository]](https://github.com/drc-cs/cs326/)

This course aims to cover data science theory and tools for obtaining, cleaning, visualizing, modeling, and interpreting data. Most of the tools introduced in this course will be based on Python, although the theory can be applied to any programming language. Ethical data science will be consistently reinforced. As an outcome of this course, students should be able to independently derive insights from real-life datasets.

## Homework

Homeworks are designed to reinforce the concepts covered in lecture.

**Due**: Homework due dates are posted in the README.

**Late Policy**: Late homeworks will drop 1 point per day (1% of your class grade).

**Platform**: A submission script has been provided to submit your homeworks, please see the homework [README](https://github.com/drc-cs/cs326/tree/main/homeworks/) page for more information.

**Collaboration**: You are encouraged to work with your peers on homeworks. However, you must submit your own work. Copying and pasting code from other sources will be detected and penalized.

## Quiz

There will be one quiz at the end of this course. The quiz will cover the theoretical and practical concepts covered in the course through a mini-project challenge that you will have 75 minutes to complete. The challenge will be styled in a format similar to an industry data science coding interview. If you follow along with the lectures and homeworks, you will be well-prepared for the quiz.
