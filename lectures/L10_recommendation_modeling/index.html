## Recommendation Systems

Why build a recommendation system? 

- **Personalization**: Users are more likely to engage with a platform that provides personalized recommendations. Spotify absolutely excels at this.

- **Increased Engagement**: Users are more likely to spend more time on a platform that provides relevant recommendations. Instagram & TikTok are great examples of this.

- **Increased Revenue**: Users are more likely to purchase items that are recommended to them. According to a report by Salesforce, you can increase conversion rates for web products by 22.66% by using an intelligent recommendation system [[source]](https://brandcdn.exacttarget.com/sites/exacttarget/files/deliverables/etmc-predictiveintelligencebenchmarkreport.pdf).

# Content-Based Filtering

</div>

<!--s-->

## Content-Based Filtering

Content-based filtering methods are based on a description of the **item** and a profile of the **user**’s preferences. A few quick definitions:

### User Matrix

- A set of data points that represents the user’s preferences. This is usually a vector of ratings or reviews of items that the user has interacted with.

### Item Matrix

- A set of data points that represents all item’s features.
- Features can be anything that describes the item, such as genre, author, or price. They can also be derived from the item’s content (TF-IDF, Word2Vec, Reduced Dimensionality, etc.)

### User-Item Similarity Matrix

- A set of data points that represents the similarity between user preferences and items.
- These similarities can be weighted by previous reviews or ratings from the user.

<!--s-->

## Content-Based Filtering | Basic Idea

The basic idea behind content-based filtering is to recommend items that are similar to those that a user liked in the past.

<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.6em; color: grey;">Rosidi</p>

<!--s-->

## Content-Based Filtering | Intuitive Example & Question 

Let's say we have a user who has rated the following movies:

- The Shawshank Redemption: <span class="code-span">5</span>
- The Godfather: <span class="code-span">4</span>

And we want to know if they will enjoy:

- The Dark Knight: <span class="code-span">?</span>
- The Notebook: <span class="code-span">?</span>

We have the following information about the movies. They are encoded as an ordered, binary array of genres:

<span class="code-span">[ Drama, Crime, Thriller, Action, Romance]</span>

- The Shawshank Redemption: <span class="code-span">Drama, Crime, Thriller</span> | <span class="code-span"> [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]</span>
- The Godfather: <span class="code-span">Drama, Crime</span> | <span class="code-span"> [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]</span>
- The Dark Knight: <span class="code-span">Drama, Crime, Action</span> | <span class="code-span"> [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]</span>
- The Notebook: <span class="code-span">Drama, Romance</span> | <span class="code-span"> [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]</span>

Using content-based filtering, should we recommend (A) The Dark Knight or (B) The Notebook to the user?

<!--s-->

## Content-Based Filtering | Similarity Metrics

<div style="font-size: 0.8em;">

Commonly, similarity is determined simply as the dot product between two vectors:

$$ \textbf{Similarity} = A \cdot B $$

But exactly as represented by our KNN lecture, we can use different similarity metrics to calculate the similarity between two vectors. Some common similarity metrics include:

- **Cosine Similarity**: Measures the cosine of the angle between two non-zero, numerical vectors.

$$ \text{Cosine Similarity} = \frac{A \cdot B}{||A|| \cdot ||B||} $$

- **Jaccard Similarity**: Measures the similarity between two sets, may be used for binary and categorical data.

$$ \text{Jaccard Similarity} = \frac{|A \cap B|}{|A \cup B|} $$

</div>
<!--s-->

## Content-Based Filtering | Evaluation

Evaluation of content-based filtering depends on the application. Ideally, you would use a prospective study (A/B testing) to see if your recommendations are leading to increased user engagement!

</div>
<div class="c2" style = "width: 40%; font-size: 0.75em;">

***A special note for student groups using recommendation models**: you may turn the problem into a supervised learning problem by using a classification or regression model to predict user ratings from item features. You can then evaluate your model using standard metrics like RMSE, MAE, etc.

## Content-Based Filtering | Pros and Cons

| Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- |
| Easy to implement | Limited to the user’s past preferences |
| No need for data on other users | Limited to the item’s features |
| Can recommend niche items | Can overfit to the user’s preferences |
| Can provide explanations for recommendations | Cold-start problem |

# Collaborative Filtering

</div>

<!--s-->

## Collaborative Filtering

### User-User Collaborative Filtering

Based on the idea that users who have "agreed in the past will agree in the future".

### Item-Item Collaborative Filtering

Based on the idea that item reviews are often grouped together.

<!--s-->

## Collaborative Filtering | User-Item Matrix

The User-Item Matrix is a matrix that represents the relationship between users and items.

You can find nearest neighbors from two different perspectives: user-user (rows) or item-item (cols).

<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.6em; color: grey;">Hashemi, 2020</p>

<!--s-->

## Collaborative Filtering | User-User

User-User Collaborative Filtering is based on the idea that users who have agreed in the past will agree in the future.

1. Create a User-Item Matrix that contains the user’s reviews of items.
2. Find users who are similar to the target user (User-User)
3. Recommend items that similar users have liked.

## Collaborative Filtering | Item-Item

Item-Item Collaborative Filtering is based on the idea that users who each liked an item will like similar items. It is different from content-based filtering because it does not have anything to do with the item characteristics.

1. Create a User-Item Matrix that represents the user’s reviews of items.
2. Find items that are often "grouped" together (Item-Item)
3. Recommend these similar items to the target user.

## Collaborative Filtering
### Filling in the Sparse Matrix

The user-item matrix is often sparse, meaning that most of the entries are missing. This is because users typically only interact with a small subset of items. This presents a problem with finding nearest neighbors. 

So, how do we fill in the gaps?

<!--s-->

## Collaborative Filtering
### Filling in the Sparse Matrix with the Scale's Mean

A simple way to fill in the gaps in the user-item matrix is to use the scale's mean. Typically you will center the data on the mean of the scale, and fill in the gaps with zero.

In the example below, the scale is from 1-5. The mean of the scale is 3. So, we subtract 3 from every existing score and replace the rest with 0.

<div class = "col-wrapper">
<div class="c1" style = "width: 50%">

### Sparse

|  | I.1 | I.2 | I.3 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| U.1 | 5 | ... | 3 |
| U.2 | 0 | 4 | ... |
| U.3 | 3 | 2 | 0 |

</div>
<div class="c2" style = "width: 50%">

### Dense

|   | I.1 | I.2 | I.3 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| U.1 | 2 | 0 | 0 |
| U.2 | -3 | 1 | 0 |
| U.3 | 0 | -1 | -3 |


</div>
</div>

<!--s-->

## Collaborative Filtering

### Filling in the Sparse Matrix with Matrix Factorization

Matrix Factorization is a technique to break down a matrix into the product of multiple matrices. It is used in collaborative filtering to estimate the missing values in the user-item matrix, and is often performed with alternating least squares (ALS).

$$ R \approx P \cdot Q^T $$

Where: 

- $R$ is the user-item matrix.
- $P$ is the user matrix.
- $Q$ is the item matrix.
- $K$ is the number of latent features.

## Collaborative Filtering | Pros and Cons

| Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- |
| Can recommend items that the user has not seen before | Cold-start problem for both users and items |
| Can recommend items that are popular among similar users | Sparsity of the user-item matrix |

## P.02 Guidelines

<div style = 'font-size: 0.9em;'>

Project 1:1 time will be held next Tuesday (05.07) in an elevator-pitch style format. Each group will have ~ 5 minutes to cover plans for the 6 steps outlined below. **Every student in the group must speak during the presentation**. Slides are encouraged, but groups will be cutoff at 5 minutes -- so use visual aids wisely! You will receive up to 1 point per step.

**Please note**: this will certainly not be enough time to get robust feedback. The goal is to get you thinking about how to present your work in a concise and engaging way. If you want actual, in-depth feedback please come to office hours or use future class working time to ask questions.

1. **Data Source**: 
      Where are you getting your data from?
2. **Data Exploration**: 
      How are you summarizing and visualizing your data? If you do some hypothesis testing or correlation analysis, that is excellent.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: 
      How are you cleaning and transforming your data?
4. **Data Modeling**: 
      What models are you using? The most straightforward approach here is to create a prediction task and use supervised ML to solve it. Recommendation models are welcome, but performance must be quantifiable for Data Interpretation (this is usually done by making your recommendation model a prediction task).
5. **Data Interpretation**: 
      How are you interpreting your results?
6. **Data Action**: 
      What are you doing with your results?

</div>
<!--s-->
